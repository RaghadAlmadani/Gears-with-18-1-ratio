- SolidWorks: is a computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided engineering (CAE) software program used primarily for 3D modeling and design. It is widely used in engineering, product design, and manufacturing to create complex assemblies, conduct simulations for stress, thermal, and motion analysis, and produce precise technical documentation.

- Gears: are mechanical components used to transmit motion and torque between shafts in a machine. They consist of a toothed wheel or cylinder that meshes with another gear or a rack to transfer rotational motion.

- Spur Gears: These have straight teeth and are used to transmit motion between parallel shafts.

- Gear ratio: refers to the relationship between the rotational speeds of two meshing gears and is determined by the number of teeth on each gear. It describes how the motion and torque are transferred from one gear to another in a gear system.
