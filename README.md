- SolidWorks: is a computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided engineering (CAE) software program used primarily for 3D modeling and design. It is widely used in engineering, product design, and manufacturing to create complex assemblies, conduct simulations for stress, thermal, and motion analysis, and produce precise technical documentation.

- Gears: are mechanical components used to transmit motion and torque between shafts in a machine. They consist of a toothed wheel or cylinder that meshes with another gear or a rack to transfer rotational motion.

- Spur Gears: These have straight teeth and are used to transmit motion between parallel shafts.

- Gear ratio: refers to the relationship between the rotational speeds of two meshing gears and is determined by the number of teeth on each gear. It describes how the motion and torque are transferred from one gear to another in a gear system.

- Gear ratio eqution: Gear Ratio = Number of Teeth on Driven Gear / Number of Teeth on Driver Gear

I used spur gears from tools library in solidworks. The driver gear is the 12 teeth gear and the driven has 72 teeth. Therefore, the gear ratio = 72/12 = 6/1 and I add 2 more gears the third gear attach with the seconed and it has 36 teeth the last gear has 108 teeth and the ration between the third and fourth gears = 108/36 = 3/1, because the third gear is the driver and the fourth become the driven. finally if we add all the 4 gears together the gear ration = 6/1 times 3/1 = 18/1.

-------------------

The challings It was hard to make the gears moving at the first time I started with 2 gears then I add the reset to understand how can I make them move in the right way. 
Resouce: here is the tutorial to make 2 gears moving in solidworks on [YouTube](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xey6WL873-E)

as you can see in the video the 2 gears have a problem when they moving.

here I fixed the problem it was because of the motion type it was animation I changed it to Basic motion
